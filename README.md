# Simple-Wordle-Solver
 Used to play your own wordle games with a solver and help solve wordle games from the website.

Note: I am not associated in any way with the creator of wordle or the New York Times.

You can also modify the wordlength and wordcount variables if you wish to use a list of words of a different length. And you can modify the number of guesses if you want to play with more or less guesses.

To build run make
Then run with ./wordle or ./wordle-unanswered
